# Explainable AI Examples Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to providing practical examples and educational resources for understanding Explainable AI (XAI). It contains notebooks and scripts demonstrating the use of various XAI frameworks such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and more to be added.

The goal is to offer a hands-on approach to learning how these tools can be used to interpret machine learning model predictions and provide insights into the decision-making process of complex algorithms.

## Contents

- `LIMEExample/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating the usage of LIME for different types of data (tabular, text, and images).
- `SHAPExample/` - Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts showing how to use SHAP to explain model predictions.
